### Introduction

We are excited to announce the initial release of NetMoni v1.0.0, a desktop utility designed for network administrators, IT professionals, and tech enthusiasts to monitor network device latency in a simple, visual, and powerful way.

### Key Features in This Release:

* **Live Latency Monitoring:** Monitor multiple IP addresses simultaneously in real-time using ICMP pings.

* **Visual Analog Dashboard:** An intuitive main dashboard displays each monitored device as an analog gauge, showing latency in milliseconds and providing instant visual feedback on network health (Green/Yellow/Red).

* **Pop-Out Desktop Widgets:** Any gauge can be "popped out" into its own standalone desktop widget for persistent monitoring while you work.

* **Advanced Widget Customization:**
    * **Position Saving:** Widgets remember their last position on your desktop.
    * **Resizable:** Right-click a widget to resize it to Small, Medium, or Large.
    * **"Keep on Top" Toggle:** A right-click option allows you to pin a widget on top of all other windows or let it behave like a normal window.
    * **Draggable & Interactive:** Widgets are semi-transparent when not in focus and can be easily moved via their dedicated grab-bar.

* **Automated Email Alerts:** Configure the application to send email alerts via an Office 365 account to a list of recipients after a device fails a set number of consecutive pings.

* **Centralized Admin Settings:** A simple settings panel allows an administrator to easily add/remove IPs to monitor, add/remove alert recipients, and configure the sender email account securely.

* **Per-IP Logging:** Every monitored device has its own dedicated log file, tracking every success, failure, and recovery event with a timestamp.

* **In-App Log Viewer:** View the detailed logs for any device directly from the main dashboard without needing to open the files manually.

* **Standalone Application:** Compiled into a single `NetMoni.exe` file that requires no installation or external dependencies.

### Known Limitations

* Desktop widgets are tied to the main application and will close when the main app is closed.
* On first run, some antivirus programs may flag the new executable as a potential threat (this is a common false positive for applications created with PyInstaller).
